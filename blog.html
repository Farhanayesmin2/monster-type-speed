          Difference between local storage and session storage.
        </h3>
        <p class="card-text">
          <strong> Local Storage and Session Storage</strong> are almost the
          same.<br />
          <b>Both have the following rules: </b> They store key/value pairs for
          a particular domain. The values stored may only be strings. They have
          a limit of around 5MB of storage space. The one major difference
          between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.
          localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if
          the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and
          reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration. sessionStorage
          is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as
          the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or
          a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.
