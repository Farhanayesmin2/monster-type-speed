          Difference between local storage and session storage.
        </h3>
        <p class="card-text">
          <strong> Local Storage and Session Storage</strong> are almost the
          same.<br />
          <b>Both have the following rules: </b> They store key/value pairs for
          a particular domain. The values stored may only be strings. They have
          a limit of around 5MB of storage space. The one major difference
          between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.
          localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if
          the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and
          reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration. sessionStorage
          is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as
          the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or
          a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.<br />
          Local storage has 4 methods:<br />
          1. setItem() Method <br />2. getItem() Method<br />
          3. removeItem() Method<br />
          4. clear() Method

          Difference between global scope and block scope.
        </h3>
        <p class="card-text">
          <strong>Global Scope </strong> <br />
          The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
          known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means
          that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
          function or conditional state can access that variable. <br />

          <strong> Block Scope </strong> <br />
          Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be
          defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}.
          Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements,
          or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables
          from within the curly brackets {}. Imagine a nested situation: A block
          of code enclosed with curly brackets{} containing some block
          variables.

        <p class="card-text">
          <strong>An Event Loop</strong> <br />
          An event loop is a programming construct that allows a program to
          handle multiple events or tasks simultaneously. Event loop is an
          endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps
          until it receives more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the
          event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing
          task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.
          <br />
          The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous
          programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using
          event loop, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.

          How to get undefined in JavaScript.
        </h3>
        <p class="card-text">
          <strong>Undefined</strong> <br />
          What is undefined The undefined is a primitive type in JavaScript. So
          the undefined is a type. And the undefined type has exactly one value
          that is undefined.
          <br />
          The undefined is a primitive type that has a single value undefined.
          <br />
          1. Accessing an uninitialized variable returns undefined. <br />
          2. Accessing a non-existing property of an object returns undefined.
          <br />
          3. Accessing a out-of-bounds array element returns undefined. <br />
          4. A function without a return statement or with a return statement
          but without an expression returns undefined.<br />
          5. If the value is not defined, typeof returns the ‘undefined’ string.
